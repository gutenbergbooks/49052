<h2>James Gordon Bennett, Horace Greeley, and Henry J. Raymond.</h2>

<p>I shall review the editorial career of these
men, (whom I regard as extremely vicious,)
and I shall begin with Bennett, because he is
the eldest and biggest villain of the trio. I
have written for the <i>Herald</i> since I was a
student at Cambridge in 1836, for which I
have received only $250. I have written for
the <i>Times</i> nearly since its advent, for which I
have received nothing. I have written for
the <i>Tribune</i> since the first year of its existence,
for which I have received nothing but
infinite detraction. So, in all I may say of
these ungrateful scoundrels, I shall evince no
ingratitude or treachery. Bennett’s face is
the reflection of hell and the prince of devils.
In conversation, he is obscene and blasphemous,
and thoroughly wicked in every thought,
and to listen to his obscenity, and blasphemy,
and corrupt suggestions, in his old age, makes
one shudder with horror to the inner temples
of the soul. He is a low and cunning Scotchman,
of a large brain, of superficial cultivation&mdash;has
no critical knowledge of grammar,
and his orthography is quite imperfect&mdash;could
accurately define Websters “science,” only as
it represents the mode of extortion&mdash;has read
very little&mdash;is an unnaturalized alien, and a
monarchist of the deepest dye. His leading
motive, since he acquired his almighty dollar
position as a journalist, has been to corrupt
the people, and thus subvert our institutions,
and cast us again into the embraces of British
despots, whom he still loves, and will ever
recognize as his native masters. His wife
permanently resides in Europe, and the son
who bears his name was educated in London,
Paris, and Vienna,&mdash;and Bennett himself has
passed most of his latter years in Europe, with
flying visits to America to black mail private
citizens and the politicians in our Municipal,
State, and National elections. As incontrovertible
evidence of his sympathy with corruptionists,
he never wrote a syllable in favor
of the election of an honorable man to office.
In the abstract, he prates of virtue, and has
always denounced public rogues as no other
man in America, but concretely and in the
assassin’s ambush, he toils from choice and for
a cash consideration to elect prison birds for
our rulers. As long as the candidate for office
holds him through a beautiful woman, or
will jingle gold before his eyes, he will sustain
him, and magnify him into a human god; but
the moment she ceases to fondle, and caress,
and hug, and kiss his hideous features, or her
beauty fades, or her paramour falls through
penury, or the loss of the public confidence,&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
one or all of these calamities transpire,
he seeks new victims, and tramples the old
like spiders, as he now does George Law and
Fernando Wood, and others, whom he has
bled of half a million. And when Mariposa
fails to yield its wonted supply of gold, he will
abandon Fremont, and support some notorious
scamp for President, who is a perjured alien,
or a great national plunderer, or a dastard
traitor to the Union of our Fathers,&mdash;provided
the candidate will give him $100,000 in
cash, with the promise of a first-class Foreign
Mission. There is a married woman alternately
in the Metropolis and its suburbs, to
whom Bennett has long been an abject slave.
And there is a woman alternately in Washington
and its suburbs, to whom President Buchanan
himself is a Russian serf. Bennett and
Buchanan, while I write, are in the embraces
of two cunning and bewitching ladies, who
control the destinies of America. It was
through the fascinations and machinations of
these two women, that George Law and Fernando
Wood ultimately fell, never to rise;
and it was through these two Cleopatras that
the English and Jewish alien, Abraham D.
Russell and Daniel E. Sickles were elected to
the Judiciary and Congress, and will be again,
as long as James Buchanan, James Gordon
Bennett, Judge Russell, Daniel E. Sickles, and
the two lovely ladies in question rule the destinies
of the White House, and meet in its
gorgeous halls, and around its festive tables.
Dan Sickles could pull Buchanan’s nose with
impunity, and Judge Russell could pinch Bennett’s
big proboscis, and he would not dare
breathe the faintest murmur. Pretty women
ruled the Egyptians, Grecians, Romans, English,
French, Germans, Spaniards, and Italians,
and why should they not rule the Americans?
Bennett’s Corporation plunder and his black
mail of politicians and private citizens will
appal the city and country, when I disclose
his prodigious operations, and place Frederick
Hudson, (his smooth Private Secretary,) and
his brother Edward W. Hudson, (the author of
the <i>Herald</i> Money Articles,) in the infamous
position of their master. Bennett and Fred
and Ned Hudson originated the Parker Vein
and Potosi villanies, through which my brother
William was reduced to beggary and
ceaseless illness, for which I will haunt them
to their capulets, and beyond, if possible.
And now, as the <i>Alligator’s</i> jaws are limited,
they cannot hold more of Bennett’s and the
two Hudsons’ carcases to-day, but he will bite
them mighty hard next week, and take larger
chunks from their black mail hides, at his
second lunge. And when my <i>Alligator’s</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
fangs reach Greeley and Raymond, he will
revel and grin and snap his jaws, and fatten
his belly, as though he was basking on the
fertile borders of the Chagres.</p>

<h2>Early Years&mdash;Senator Henry B. Anthony.</h2>

<p>When I was in the Providence Post Office,
Henry B. Anthony was a student of Brown
University, whose noble father resided in Coventry,
and the pale and delicate Henry would
descend College Hill at evening shades, and
present his sweet little face at the Post Office
window, and inquire in solicitous and music
tones: “Good Stephen, did my dear father or
mother write me to-day?” And if I said yes,
his tiny face reflected the innocent hilarity of
childhood. But if I said no, he would depart in
silence, with tears careering on his brilliant and
intellectual eyes. One summer evening, while
in the doorway of the Post Office, we had a
long political disputation. Henry was a Whig
and I a Democrat. He was a Hamiltonian,
and I a Jeffersonian. Samuel and Joseph
Bridgham, Wm. Henry Manton, Giles Eaton,
David Perkins, Halsey Creighton, Edward
Hazard, Nathan F. Dixon, George Rivers, and
other students of Brown University, were
there, and most of them were Whigs, and opposed
to Gen. Jackson, who was then President.
We had a very exciting discussion, and
the students applauded as we warmed and
glowed and rounded our periods; but Henry
received the most applause, and I the
most hisses. I endured all this with composure;
but when Henry corrected my pronunciation
of the military word “corps,” (kore,)
which I pronounced like corpse, (korps,) a dead
body,&mdash;he brought blushes to my cheeks, and
copious blood to my brain, and the conquest
was his, and I retired into the Post Office, and
studied dictionary for some time, and resolved
to acquire the principles of the English language.
And from that memorable evening, I
have been a laborious student. When this
same Henry B. Anthony became Governor of
Rhode Island, my father was the Senator from
Providence County, which is the second
honor of the State Administration, and the
duties more arduous than those of the Governor
himself. And father has told me that
Henry often consulted him during his Gubernatorial
Administration. When poor father
died, I called on Henry at the <i>Providence
Journal</i> office, who received me with the cordiality
of a brother, and said: “Stephen: My
father has recently died, and I profoundly
sympathize with you, as I know what it is to
lose a good father like mine. As to your father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Rhode Island never had a wiser nor a better
citizen, nor a purer patriot,&mdash;and years will
roll ere she will rear a man of his integrity
and penetration. Our whole State is in tears,
and will ever cherish him with warm affection.”
Henry was elected an American Senator
last week from Rhode Island, and here
am I, with a dagger and revolver in my hand,
exposing the robbers and parricides of my
country, and with not one truly reliable friend
in all the world; and even the few dollars that
I recently received from the Corporation for
public services, are in ceaseless danger through
the stealth of heartless and greedy wretches,
whose avarice will never be satiated until they
have wrested the very last farthing from
trembling hands that are in constant peril of
paralysis. And now, dear Henry, receive my
most affectionate congratulation on mounting
the ladder of your highest ambition. But if
you join the plunderers and traitors of the
Senate, and be recreant to truth and justice&mdash;to
Greene and Perry&mdash;to the Rhode Island
Line, so fondly cherished by Washington&mdash;and
to our dear native soil, and to the loved
stars of our glorious canopy, and of the long,
dark, cold, dreary, and sleepless nights of
the Revolution,&mdash;if you be recreant to these
sacred lights of our early years, I will paralyze
you with execrations,&mdash;and if I survive
you, I will trample and blight the verdure that
blushes over your odious and accursed mausoleum.</p>

<h2>The Patient and Doctor&mdash;The First Interview.</h2>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Doctor, I have got the piles and
dyspepsia most awfully. I have taken lots of
medicine, and it has made me more costive,
and caused my head to ache worse than ever.
Now, Doctor, what on earth shall I do to cure
me of the piles and dyspepsia?</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Buy <span class="smcap">Branch’s Alligator</span>.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;What kind of medicine is that?</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;It ain’t medicine. It is a pepper.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;What kind of pepper?</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;A darn funny pepper.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;How can that cure the piles and
dyspepsia?</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;It will make you laugh and cry at
the same time, and move your bowels, and it
actually gave one of my patients the diarrhœa
and hysteric cramps in the stomach last week.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Where can I find it?</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;At any depot in the city.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;I will try it. How much shall I
pay you for your medical advice?</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Only one dollar.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;There it is. Good day, Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Good day.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;(stumbles going down the steps)&mdash;It
looks awful cloudy, Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Quite so. It looks like rain.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Yes, rather. Good day, Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Good day. Call again.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;I will. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<h3>SECOND INTERVIEW.</h3>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Good morning, Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;How do you do?</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;I am so weak I can hardly stand.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;It must be owing to the warm
weather.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;No it ain’t. I have been reading
<i>Branch’s Alligator</i>, and I have got the dysentery
so bad that I fear I shall lose my entrails
and die before sundown, if you don’t
give me something to stop it. Why, lord bless
your dear soul, Doctor, I was up all last night,
and have been out ten times to-day. O do
relieve and save me, Doctor. Only give me
back my piles and dyspepsia again, and I’ll
be satisfied. The dysentery is more dangerous
than either, and I’m not prepared to die. I
joined the Church at the time Awful Gardner
and Ex-Alderman Wesley Smith did, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
didn’t hold on, and I am worse now than I
was before I joined the Old Dutch Church in
Fulton street. Do save me, Doctor, do. O
do! All this trouble has come upon me, because
you told me to read <i>Branch’s Alligator</i>,
which made me laugh so, that my bowels got
under way, and I couldn’t stop them. Do save
me, dear Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Do you ever read the <i>Herald</i>, <i>Times</i>,
or <i>Tribune</i>?</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;No. I consider it a sin to read
those papers.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Why?</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Because they lie and black mail
so, and deceive and sell the people, and plunder
them, and erect such elegant buildings
with their plunder. They never could make
so much money by honorable industry.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Well, now, you go and buy a copy
of the <i>Herald</i>, <i>Times</i>, and <i>Tribune</i>, and go
home and read the editorials, and the letters of
their Albany and Washington correspondents,
and their mercenary Wall street money articles,
and read their billingsgate of each other,
and their horrible black mail articles, and
they will so thrill your blood, as to produce
an instant reaction, and you will soon be more
costive than before you read <i>Branch’s Alligator</i>.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;I’ll do it. How much shall I pay
you for your advice?</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Not a cent.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;You are too generous, Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Not at all. Those editors ain’t
worth a cent, only what they steal from the
government, and the politicians, and the people.
They don’t make a millionth as much
on their paper and advertisements, as they do
on black mail. They are the source of all governmental
evil.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Them’s my sentiments exactly.
Good morning. Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Good morning, patient. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<h3>THIRD INTERVIEW.</h3>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Good evening, Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Good evening.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Well, Doctor, the <i>Herald</i>, <i>Times</i>,
and <i>Tribune</i> have cured me. I swow, Doctor,
how Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond can
lie. I read their fibs, white and black, and
their billingsgate of each other, and their
abuse of private citizens, and contractors, and
politicians, (which seemed like polite invitations
for interested parties to walk up to their
gilded offices and settle,) until my blood run
cold, and icicles formed in my veins, and my
zig-zag circulation flew about and rushed
from my toes, fingers, nose, ears, heart, and
liver, into my skull, until my dysentery
was reduced from ten to four times a
day; and then I put ice on my head, and a
poultice over my navel, and bathed my spleen
with brandy, and went to bed, and slept like
Rip Van Winkle, and I now feel as well as I
did at my birth,&mdash;and I have come to express
my gratitude, and pay you a standing fee for
disclosing the important secret, that I can always
cure the piles and dysentery by reading
the abominable lies and black mail editorials
of the <i>Herald</i>, <i>Times</i>, and <i>Tribune</i>.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;I am of a costive nature, and never
have the piles nor dysentery, and therefore
never read those disreputable newspapers;
but if I ever should have the cholera, or violent
diarrhœa, I should read those public journals
for my life, as I have cured dysentery
patients for years by recommending the perusal
of those journals for only half an hour. And I
shall always recommend <i>Branch’s Alligator</i>
for costiveness.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Don’t mention the <i>Alligator</i>, if
you please, Doctor, because I fear it will start
my bowels, and again set them in a terrible
and dangerous commotion. So, good night,
Doctor, and may God forever bless you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Good night, sir.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Remember me kindly to your wife
and children, Doctor.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;I will.</p>

<p><i>Patient</i>&mdash;Good night.</p>

<p><i>Doctor</i>&mdash;Good night. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<p>The Doctor closes the door, and Patient
skips up the street, singing, <i>a la Bayadere</i>:</p>

<p class="ppn6">Happy am I,<br />
From piles I’m free,<br />
Why are not all<br />
Merry like me?</p>

<p><i>Driver</i>&mdash;How many have you got?</p>

<p><i>Dad</i>&mdash;Myself and two female children&mdash;two
girls in their teens, and my wife and
mother.</p>

<p><i>Driver</i>&mdash;Yes, daddy, I can accommodate
you, as I have just got room for yourself, old
boy, and your two female children, and two
kegs, and your two girls in their teens, and
two barrels, and for your wife and mother,
and two hogsheads. Jump in, old cock, with
all your tribes and trappings.</p>

<p><i>Dad</i>&mdash;Thank you, driver, thank you,&mdash;but
darn your impudent reflections about crinoline.
But it rains, and I’m anxious to get
home, and I’ll forgive your facetious comments
this time. There, now, get in wife,
and mother, and girls, and children&mdash;get in
as fast as possible, and get out of the rain, and
save your bonnets, and shawls, and silks, and
kegs, barrels, and hogsheads, that our waggish
driver prates of with such truthful severity.</p>

<p><i>Driver</i> (peeping through the hole)&mdash;Are
you all right inside, daddy? Crinoline all
nicely arranged and tucked in? eh? old cock?</p>

<p><i>Dad</i>&mdash;Go ahead, you rascal. I’ll tell Mayor
Tiemann and Peter Cooper of your didos,
and have you arrested.</p>

<p><i>Driver</i>&mdash;Laughs, and snaps his whip, and
away they go.</p>

<h2>A Queer Letter.</h2>

<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, May 28th, 1858.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Stephen H. Branch, Esq.</span>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;As a reader of your rapacious
<span class="smcap">Alligator</span>, and a warm sympathiser with
you throughout your misfortunes, I think I
am entitled to make a suggestion, which I
believe to be for your own good. I want to
praise the manner in which you have conducted
your Journal thus far, and it is because
I do not, wish to see it unworthy of consideration
that I have taken the liberty to write to
you&mdash;a perfect stranger, as far as personal
acquaintance goes. Your sanguinary and characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
fearless attacks on the magnates of
Tammany and the City Hall have won you
great favor among the honest and peaceful
citizens of New York, as well as elsewhere,
but I am of opinion that an attack on the city
press would only be productive of serious mischief
to yourself. In your latest number,
you mention the apparent slight of the <span class="smcap">Alligator</span>
by Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond,
and avow your intention to “let up” on
them in your next. I seriously advise you not
to do it. It will hurt you. Only a week
since you spoke of your unwillingness to attack
and expose Russell, because he is Bennett’s
friend, <i>who aided you in your misfortunes</i>.
It may hurt the man’s feelings somewhat
to see his friends or relations calumniated
or condemned, but it is much worse (and
savors of ingratitude in the assailant) to be
set upon himself. Besides, if you wake the
wrath of these three Leviathans, it will take
a bigger and stronger animal than the <span class="smcap">Alligator</span>
to extinguish it. It is therefore a matter
of policy in you not to weaken yourself
by entering into a war with the <i>Herald</i>, <i>Times</i>,
or <i>Tribune</i>. You are yet weak, and need all
the help you can possibly obtain. You know
yourself that newspapers are not established
in a day, however high their aim or select
their contributions, and to be drawn into a
controversy with the papers named, will be
almost fatal to your editorial prospects.</p>

<p>Again: they may have reasons for not noticing
your paper, as a press of business, neglect,
overlooking, and so forth, and may,
when a more convenient season presents itself,
give you a highly flavored puff. Would it not
be better to ask them privately to speak favorably
of your new enterprise, than to attempt
to force them to do it by a public attack in
your paper?</p>

<p>Yours very respectfully, and with sincere
wishes for your welfare,</p>

<p class="pr4">R. P. C.</p>

<p>(Private.)</p>

<p class="p1">This letter came from the <i>Herald</i>, <i>Times</i>,
and <i>Tribune</i> offices, and was the result of the
deliberations of Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond,
through their Secretaries, Hudson,
Dana, and Tuthill. My heart was moved
while reading this production. The genial
spirits of Houston and Hamilton, of the <i>Herald</i>,
and of the equally meritorious dead in
the <i>Times</i> and <i>Tribune</i> establishments, passed
before my vision, and I was unmanly, and
wept like a delicate female. And with electric
flights of the imagination, I grasped the
long and happy years I have passed in the
<i>Herald</i>, <i>Times</i>, and <i>Tribune</i> offices, in the
pleasing effort to improve the Fire and Police
Departments. I thought, too, of the noble
band of intellectual living giants connected
with the Metropolitan Press in question, and
I wept to know that we would be less friendly,
and that my form and intellect were never
more to be reflected by the leading Press of
America. And why must this be so? Why
must I pass in silence, in my whole journey to
the grave, such men as Bennett, Greeley, and
Raymond, and their Secretaries, Hudson,
Dana, and Tuthill? Is it because they have
not noticed the <span class="smcap">Alligator</span>? I would despise
myself, if I could be governed by so mean a
motive. A spark will light a flame that will
defy a million men. Isolated snow will come
silently from Heaven, and form mountains
that will bury thousands. And I admit that
after my gratuitous labors in the <i>Herald</i>,
<i>Times</i>, and <i>Tribune</i> establishments for so
many years, (in which I devoted the integrity
and education that my father
gave me,) the refusal of Bennett, Greeley,
and Raymond to notice my feeble efforts
to establish a truthful press, kindled a blaze
in my bosom that they can never quench.
For seven weeks I looked with solicitude for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the mention of my Journal in their columns,
and crushed to the earth with pain and disgust
with my species, I resolved to dissect the
bodies that were animated by such contracted
souls. Their refusal to notice and encourage
the efforts of an old and tried friend like me,
(who has toiled so long and hard to give them
important public documents and early valuable
domestic and foreign intelligence,) aroused
a million demons that have slumbered in
my bosom, and yearned for years to expose
the villainy of American editors, who hold
the destinies of my country and of human
liberty in their palms, and who trifle and play
with the people, and sell them like cattle in
the face of the morning sun. Bennett, Greeley,
and Raymond never meet by daylight,
but they do by night light in great emergencies.
They fret and scold before the people,
but they act in concert in subterranean caverns.
And their Secretaries, Hudson, Dana,
and Tuthill, daily walk arm-in-arm, plotting
deeds of hell for their wicked masters,
in which the people are invariably
sold. And so with the money-article writers
of these public journals. They see each other
often, and act in concert, and spread terror
in Wall street, and throughout the country,
and desolate the hearth of many a happy domestic
circle, in the journey of every sun.
And shall I be silent, and go down to my
grave, with these fatal secrets on my heart,
that have depressed me for years? Shall I be
recreant to my mission, and to the toiling millions,
on whom their accursed treason falls?
Shall I not tell the American people, that the
evils and corruption that overshadow our
land, and threaten to subvert our glorious institutions,
have their source in the American
Press? And shall I not adduce my proof and
argument, and scathing analysis of their pernicious
motives? And shall I be silenced by the
threats in this letter, that I will be crushed by
three Leviathans the instant I open my fatal
batteries? No, no. All hell shall not deter
me from my exposition of Bennett, Greeley,
and Raymond, and their vile Secretaries. For
my honor I care every thing, and he who
strives to deprive me of it, through unmerited
detraction, shall die by my avenging
hand. But for life I care nothing, only to be
useful to my kind, and to adhere to integrity,
and serve the God of my supreme adoration.
Life! Take it! Take the poor, trembling,
pining, mortal trunk and scabbard, but beware
of the sword and soul! Look, but touch not
them, lest the ground rock, and open, and
yawn, and swallow, and cut, and dash, and
burn your demon bones and nerves through
undying ages. Beware! I say! O beware!
and tremble! For I have a superstition, that
a soul is sacred in the eyes of God, according
to its love of truth, or its hatred and horror
of such hypocrites, thieves, and traitors, as
Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond.</p>

<h2>Life of Stephen H. Branch.</h2>

<p>The news of my return to Providence spread
rapidly, and the political newspapers unfriendly
to father most cruelly announced my
arrival in blazing capitals. I then told my
father that if he would furnish me the means,
I would go to the sea shore, and he instantly
complied. I departed for Boston with White,
whose father resided in Pepperell, Massachusetts,
whither he went, and I took the stage
to Salem and Gloucester, near Cape Ann.
When I parted with White, I was overwhelmed
with tears and desolation. I passed the
first night in Gloucester at a hotel, and the
next day engaged private board. I now was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
very lonely,&mdash;had no congenial spirit by my
side,&mdash;knew no one in Gloucester,&mdash;was a
mere skeleton,&mdash;could not read nor compose,
without suffusing my brain with blood, and I
sometimes thought I should drop dead, and
seriously contemplated self-destruction. But
the ocean air revived me, and I gave lessons
in penmanship to a Mr. Story and his two
sons, who gave me $5 a week, which defrayed
my expenses, and diverted my mind from the
melancholy past, which was a precious
solace. The summer closed, and the
leaves began to fall, and the first blast of
autumn made its advent from the north, and
I returned to Boston, and went to New York
by way of Hartford and New Haven. I engaged
board with Mrs. Reeve, in Pearl street,
near Franklin Square, and hired a cheap
piano of Firth, Hall, &amp; Pond, and gave English
lessons to the son of Mr. Vultee, for
which he imparted musical instruction. I
then went to Arthur Tappan, and informed
him that I contemplated the instruction of
colored persons, who sent me to his brother,
Lewis Tappan, with whom I had a long conversation,
at his store in Pearl street, during
which he examined my qualifications in spelling,
reading, figures, and penmanship, and
gave me a letter of introduction to a colored
man named Van Ransselaer, who kept a restaurant
under the office of the <i>Journal of
Commerce</i>. I taught Mr. and Mrs. Van Ransselaer
and their adopted boy for some weeks,
for which I received my meals at their restaurant.
They had a room in the sixth story
of one of the Wall street buildings, and, in
climbing the stairs, I often thought I should
die before I reached the upper story. I now
see an advertisement, and obtain a situation
as teacher on the plantation of Mr. Bennett,
near Franklin, Alabama, and departed for
Apalachicola, in the brig Sampson, Captain
Robinson. The passengers could scarcely
move in consequence of the barrels of potatoes
and apples on deck. We paid our passage
in advance. The proprietors of the vessel
allowed the captain a limited sum for sailors,
and, to save a portion of the money for
himself, the captain obtained most of his sailors
from the hospital, from those just recovering
from protracted illness. One was lame,
and another had but one eye, and all were
pale and extremely feeble. We had a gale off
Cape Hatteras, and some of the more emaciated
sailors were instantly prostrated, and retired
to their berths, and the passengers had
to work night and day, or go to the bottom of
the ocean. In a week after I left New York, my
hands were nearly raw with blisters from
hauling ropes. The owners permitted the
captain to provision the vessel as he pleased,
and render his account to them at the close of
the voyage, and he nearly starved us, although
he charged the proprietors of the vessel for the
best provisions the market afforded. I often
caught the captain drinking wines and eating
luxuries behind the masts, which the passengers
should have had, and I denounced him,
but to no purpose. I discovered the helmsman
asleep at midnight, and the vessel going
stern foremost, and aroused the passengers
just in time to save all from a watery grave.
There was a passenger who had been a skilful
mariner, and we acted in concert, or we must
have been lost. We watched the helmsman
on alternate nights, but got weary of the task,
and shared the toil with other passengers. I
emerged from my berth at midnight, and
found both passenger and helmsman asleep,
when I aroused all hands to witness the extraordinary
spectacle, and our common peril,
and, after that, the passengers formed a Vigilance
Committee to unceasingly watch the
captain and sailors. In a week, land was discovered,
although the captain assured us one
hour before the discovery, that we were about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
one hundred miles from land. It was near
sunset, and if we had not discovered land
before dark, we would have gone ashore, and
been drowned, or butchered by the hostile
Indians on the coast of Florida, who
were then engaged in their final struggle with
the Americans. We had a hurricane soon
afterwards, and lost all the apples and potatoes
from the deck, but we at last arrived
at Key West. We took in water, and some
bread and herrings, and steered for Apalachicola,
and on the following day, we took four
men from a vessel that must have sunk in one
hour after we rescued them. The poor fellows
had been several days on the wreck,
without food or water, and they shivered and
cried like children, when they reached our
vessel. It was a very affecting scene, and
none could restrain their tears. We had a gale
in the Gulf of Mexico, and expected to be
lost, but we ultimately reached Apalachicola,
which I found a perfect desert. My employer,
and a wagon with two horses, anticipated my
arrival, and we went to Saint Joseph, and
thence up the banks of the Chattahoochee
River, and often passed near the encampment
of hostile tribes of Indians. There had been
no rain for two months, and the woods were
on fire at times throughout the journey, which
presented at night a scene of great sublimity.
We were often surrounded by smoke and
flame, and were scorched and nearly strangled
by the dense smoke that emanated from the
burning pine trees. On one occasion, the
horses were unmanageable, and ran towards
the flames, and we supposed we would be lost,
but we subdued the terror of the horses, and
emerged from the flames after infinite peril
and trouble. The miserable habitations were
often thirty miles apart, and we nearly died
from thirst, but we reached Franklin, Alabama,
after unexampled suffering. I soon
repaired to Bennett’s Plantation, five miles
from Franklin, and opened my school, near
his house, in a log cabin, to which Bennett
permitted children to come from the surrounding
country. My health was poor, and I
nearly died with dyspepsia. I soon discovered
that Bennett was intemperate and cruel to his
slaves, most of whom had committed grave
offences, and had been confined in the prisons
of Georgia and Alabama. Bennett’s Overseer
whipped the slaves every morning, and my
feelings were lacerated almost beyond endurance,
when I heard the lash, and their piercing
cries for mercy. Mike, a slave, fled in
the night, and Bennett and the Overseer pursued
and captured him partially drunk in a
swamp. They tied him to a tree, near my
window, and paddled him with a wooden
spade full of holes, which brought blood and
blisters at every blow. I had witnessed the
executions of murderers at the North, but I
never beheld brutality like this. I closed my
window, and went to bed, and buried myself
in the clothes, so that I could not hear the
blows, and poor Mike’s thrilling appeals for
succor. Chloe, a slave from Africa, (who was
seventy years old, and had been the slave of
Bennett’s father,) told a lie to screen one of
her children, who had been absent two nights
on a drunken frolic, and she was tied to a tree,
and severely horsewhipped on her naked back.
I shall never forget the moans of poor
Chloe, as the whip lacerated her scanty flesh,
and aged bones. Mrs. Bennett taught her
children, male and female, to whip the children
slaves, and when they did not strike
hard, she would fly into a fearful passion, and
lash her own children for their lenity towards
the sinless little slaves. These cruel scenes
disgusted and harrowed my heart beyond the
power of language to express, and I resolved
to resort to honorable stratagem to get away
from Bennett’s Plantation. So, on Bennett’s
return from his favorite amusement of hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
deer at night, with which the country
teemed, he was very proud of his success in
killing deer, and was partially intoxicated,
and in sparkling humor, and I breathed in
his merry ears the following plaintive intelligence.
I told him that I was ill, and anticipated
a return of fits, which sometimes tormented
me for months,&mdash;that, at times, when
I emerged from these fits, I was wild and dangerous,
unless confined in irons, and that I
once nearly strangled a child, during my delirium.
He started back, and stared like an
owl, and his wife opened her mouth, and
stretched her large gray eyes prodigiously,
and asked me how long I had had symptoms
of the return of fits. I said, about two days.
Bennett then inquired about how long before
I expected they would commence. I replied,
in a day or two. He asked me if I desired to
return to Apalachicola, and thence to New
York, or would rather go by way of Columbus,
Georgia. I told him that I had a brother
in New Orleans, who was proprietor of the
“<i>New Orleans Daily Times</i>,” and I would
like to go to him, as he knew how to nurse
me, when the fits were on. He said that he
would let his slave Edward take me in his
wagon down the banks of the Chattahoochee,
to the point where the mail stage passed, on
its way to Lagrange, where I could get a
steamer to Pensacola, and thence to Mobile
and New Orleans. I told him that I had no
money. He said he would supply me with
enough to defray my expenses to New Orleans.
In the morning, while the Overseer
was whipping slaves in the yard, I started
down the Chattahoochee, and, after an encampment
of three nights, reached the road that
led to Lagrange. On the following day, the
stage arrived, and I left for Lagrange. General
James Hamilton, of South Carolina, was a passenger,
with whom I had many a pleasant
conversation. After a tedious journey through
the piny solitudes of Florida, we arrived at
Lagrange, and left for Pensacola, in a ricketty
steamer, in which we came near being lost in
the Gulf of Mexico, in about half a gale. At
Pensacola, we took the steamer Champion,
and proceeded to Mobile, and thence to New
Orleans, by way of Lake Pontchartrain. I
boarded with my brother Albert in Poydras
street, and worked in his printing office. I
learned, through the newspapers, that the
Captain left Apalachicola for Havana, but
couldn’t find it, and went to Key West&mdash;that
he left for New York, and was capsized in the
Atlantic ocean, and only the second mate was
saved, who stated in substance that “six of us
were on a raft for nine days, and, after we ate
the dog, we drew lots for each other, and that
he who drew the shortest piece of shirt from
my inclosed hand, should die, but have the
privilege of resisting the other five in their
attempted slaughter of his body for his blood
and flesh as their water and food,&mdash;that a
Hungarian passenger drew the shortest cut,
and fought for his life for two hours, on the
raft, which was the roof of the deck cabin,
and very large, and could hold twenty men
with safety,&mdash;that the Hungarian at last fell
asleep at midnight, against his will, and we
cut his head entirely off, and drank his blood,
and ate his flesh, and I never relished any food
like the Hungarian’s,&mdash;that on the tenth day,
the first mate died from eating too heartily of
the Hungarian, and on the eleventh day a passenger
and sailor died from exhaustion,&mdash;that
on the twelfth day a vessel came near, and
while on a mountain wave just over my head,
the cook discovered myself and the last sailor
down in the cavern of the ocean,&mdash;the cook
screamed,&mdash;the helmsman discovered us,&mdash;a
rope was cast, and I seized it, and tied it
around me,&mdash;another is thrown,&mdash;I tied it
around my comrade, and gave the signal to
hoist away, and up we went into the vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
but, alas! my sailor boy was dead, dying
from exhaustion and excessive joy at his too
sudden and unexpected rescue!” This melancholy
news cast a profound gloom over my
meditations for several weeks. I now see an
advertisement for a teacher in Napoleonville,
on Bayou Lafourche, about twenty miles from
Donaldsonville, and seventy-five miles west of
New Orleans, on the plantation of Thomas
Pugh, who was a classmate of President Polk,
the Reverend Doctor Hawks, and the Reverend
Doctor Thomas House Taylor, of Grace
Church, and other distinguished men, at
Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Albert C. Ainsworth
and Senator Conrad, of New Orleans,
gave me letters to Mr. Pugh, which secured
the situation. Mr. Pugh was a Member of the
Legislature, and so was Mr. Conrad. Mr.
Ainsworth was a native of Providence, Rhode
Island, and an old school mate of mine, whose
father was a school master. Mr. Pugh had
about two hundred slaves on his sugar and
cotton plantations, and his brother, just below
him, on the Bayou, had a thousand slaves. I
found Mr. Thomas Pugh to be a noble character,
and very kind to his slaves, who most
fondly loved him. I had a school house in the
centre of a beautiful field, to which came the
pretty children of Mr. Pugh, and about a
dozen others from the contiguous plantations.
I had six hundred dollars per annum, and a
horse to ride when I chose, and a slave named
Nathan to wait upon me. The country teemed
with poultry, and we had the most delicious
oysters, and all the choice fruits and
vegetables of those sunny and prolific latitudes.
I was thrown from my horse one
moonlight evening, while riding along the
Bayou, and soon after was bitten by a snake,
and in about a week found a lizzard in my
bed when I awoke in the morning, and I got
uneasy and very nervous, and left Mr. Pugh
and his interesting family with tearful sorrow,
because they had treated me with parental
kindness. I returned to New Orleans, and
engaged passage in a steamer for Louisville,
Kentucky.</p>
